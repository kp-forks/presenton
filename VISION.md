# Vision

Presenton exists to make local AI visual asset generation simple, powerful, and private.

AI should not only produce unstructured text blobs. It should generate structured, beautiful visual documents with layout, hierarchy, themes, diagrams, and design systems built in from the start.

Visual asset generation must not require surrendering data to external platforms. It must run locally. It must work inside private networks. It must remain usable in controlled and air gapped environments.

Users should be free to choose their models. Local models. Open models. Proprietary providers. Hybrid setups. Text models and image models working together. Systems such as Ollama or any compatible runtime. No lock in.

Templates and Designs are first class citizens. Users should be able to create them, modify them, package them, share them internally, and distribute them publicly. Themes and Asset packs can be configured manually.

Presenton is an open source document engine, not a closed design platform. It is infrastructure for AI native visual workflows. Portable. Extensible. Model agnostic. Private by default.

Our ambition is to become the open foundation for local, private, AI powered visual document generation.

Beautiful visual assets. Generated locally. Owned by the user.
